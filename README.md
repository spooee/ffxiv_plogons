# PLOGONS
A repository featuring my Dalamud plugins for Final Fantasy XIV.

### Autobhop
Automatically jump as soon as you touch the ground, which replicates auto bunnyhop!

### Don't Forget
Automatically summon your fairy or carbuncle when entering an instance or starting a new pull, as well as automatically activate Peloton outside of combat!

### Custom Idle
Automatically perform an emote of your choosing when your character stops moving!
